  He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him that the Nth term is related to prime numbers. 
  The Nth term is the difference of N and the closest prime number to N. Help him find the Nth term for a given N.

  bool isPrime(int N){
	    for(int i=2;i<N;i++){
	        if(N%i==0){
	            return false;
	        }
	       
	    }
	     return true;
	}
		int NthTerm(int N){
		    // Code here
		    
		    int ans1=N;
		    int ans2=N;
		    
		    if(N==1){
		        return 1;
		    }
		    
		    while(!isPrime(ans1)){
		        ans1++;
		    }
		    while(!isPrime(ans2)){
		        ans2--;
		    }
		    return min( (ans1-N),(N-ans2) );
